# DaisyUI Configuration and Usage Guide

## Configuration
The project uses DaisyUI for component styling and theming. The configuration is defined in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts).

Key configuration points:
- All DaisyUI themes are enabled
- Default dark theme is set to "dark"
- Base styles and styled components are enabled
- No prefix is used for DaisyUI classes
- Logging is disabled for cleaner development output

## Component Usage
When building components:
1. Use DaisyUI's built-in classes for consistent styling
2. Combine with Tailwind's utility classes when needed
3. Prefer DaisyUI components over custom implementations for:
   - Buttons (`btn` classes)
   - Cards (`card` classes)
   - Modals (`modal` classes)
   - Forms (`form-control` classes)
   - Navigation (`navbar` classes)

## Theme System
- DaisyUI themes are globally available
- Use data-theme attribute to change themes
- Theme changes should be managed through a theme context/provider

## Best Practices
1. Always check DaisyUI's documentation for available components
2. Use semantic class names (e.g., `btn-primary` over custom color utilities)
3. Leverage DaisyUI's modifier classes (e.g., `btn-sm`, `btn-lg`)
4. Combine with [components/**/*.tsx](mdc:components) for reusable UI elements
